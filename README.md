# reflector

## Example

```c++
#pragma once
#include "Component.mirror.h" /// This .mirror.h file will be autogenerated and placed next to its corresponding Component.h file

namespace Ass /// Namespaces are ignored right now
{
  /// Classes are declared like this. Right now they have to derive (at some point) from Reflector::Reflectable.
  /// Support for "structs", reflected classes with no bases, is coming.
  RClass({"Category": "Components", "Icon": "ICON_FA_CUBE"})
  class Component : public Reflector::Reflectable
  {
    /// Classes need to have this macro at the beginning. It automatically sets the following members to `public:`.
    RBody()

    /// Fields are declared like this. All reflected entities can have properties. These can be queried at runtime. Compile-time property queries
    /// would also be possible, but are not available right now. Properties are stored as JSON strings, and, if nlohmann/json is included, as nlohmann::json values.
    /// Some properties modify the behavior of the Reflector, e.g. generate getters/setters.
    RField({"ReadOnly": true, "Required": true, "Setter": false})
    std::string Name;

    /// Methods are declared like this. They have to have trailing return types at the moment. This will change in the future, at least
    /// for simple types.
    RMethod()
    auto SetName(std::string_view name) -> void;

    /// Methods can be virtual, and can have inline bodies. Right now there is support for generating "binding" methods (for scripting languages
    /// like Lua, etc.) - static functions with a common signature that call the reflected method.
    RMethod()
    virtual auto OnLoadRequested() -> void
    {
      LoadResources();
    }
    
  protected:

    virtual void LoadResources() {}
    
    virtual void Instantiate() {}

    /// Fields and methods can be of any access level. Comments that start with '///' like this one will be included
    /// in the reflection data.
    RField({"ParentPointer": true})
    class Object* mParentObject = nullptr;
  };

  /// Enums can also be reflected.
  /// Right now, only enum classes are supported.
  /// Enumerators can have initializers, but only integer literal initializers are supported right now.
  REnum()
  enum class TestEnum
  {
    A = 5,
    B,
    C
  };
}
```
